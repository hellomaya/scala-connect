An web app to support SCRUM project management philosophy. 

SCRUM is a swift and agile project management metholody, and it's not invented for software development!!

Practically I think it's the best so far.

## What is it

The web app will provide facilities and tools to manage project by SCRUM.

Even though, it wasn't sufficient now, but it will be growing and be useful.

## Development

- Bootstrap css framework 3.3.6+
- AngularJS 1.x.x
- Play framework 2.x.x+
- Play slicks 3.x.x
- MySQL
- Try ruby on rails
- Or maybe more

## Progress

- Looking for the best practice with Play framework
- Suspended, 2015.12.25, instead, focus on important things
