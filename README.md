## Conduct of Contribution

Please read it first before you would like to contribute anything.

Currently I have no idea the best practice of Play, Slick or Scala,
and this project, for me, is to learn them by practicing.

So we don't really try to complete it as an app, instead we build it
to adopt more and more best practice, we learned, so we might keep
changing it to make that meet.

I recommanded we write wiki page to record what we got about :

- The best practice of Play framework
- The best practice of Slick

Constantly, so we can really learn Play, Slick and Scala (some).

##### Style

- It's learning project
- No task assignment
- Free style, coz I don't know you are wrong
- Share your knowledge at wiki, is recommended!
- By using English is required
- Translation will be conducted after that

##### Coding

- Fork the repo first
- Open a new issue, tell about your plan/change
- Then coding, testing your change before pull request
- Write test case always
- Submit pull request, when its ready
- Tell others how to test it in the issue by comment

##### The format of your plan/change in the issue

```
## Story (Tell us what you plan)

To add table NNN, and its model/service as well

## Promise (Tell us what it will meet)

And it will be

- To add the table/...
- ....
- ....
```

Then when it's ready, add more in comment of this issue

```

## Add table in ... (Tell us what you really do)

Pull request #link of it

## How to test (Tell us how to test it)

The test case is in ..., ...
```

##### Be nice

Be graceful, no dirty word in code/comment/issue, and else where.

As we are learning, so whatever your level is, pleas trying to treat
anyone else nicely, I like this motto, "Be nice, because the one
you are talking to, might be only 12"
